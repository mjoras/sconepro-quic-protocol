Abstract

   This document describes a wire format and a set of procedures used to
   communicate network properties between a content endpoint and an on-
   path device.  The network properties are intended to enable self-
   adaptation of video media rates by content endpoints.

   The wire format in this document is defined as a new version of QUIC
   that adheres to the version-independent properties of QUIC specified
   in RFC 8999.  Messages are sent adjacent to already established QUIC
   version 1 or version 2 connections on the same UDP 4-tuple.  This
   version of QUIC uses long headers for all its communication, and
   packet protection is achieved using publicly known keys.

1.  Introduction

   The basic idea of SCONEPRO is to use an independent flow between a
   client endpoint and devices in the network, in parallel to an end-to-
   end QUIC connection [RFC 9000], to exchange network properties.  This
   independent flow uses a separate version of QUIC.  This document will
   not describe what information is exchanged for these properties, but
   rather the overall way in which the communication functions.

   The version of QUIC defined in this document protects packets using
   publicly known keys, which means that confidentiality and integrity
   of protocol payload cannot be guaranteed.  The document describes how
   a connection can be upgraded to a QUIC version that supports full TLS
   protection.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  New QUIC Version

   RFC 8999 defines the version independent properties of QUIC to
   consist of long and short header packets and version negotiation
   packets.  This document defines a new version of QUIC which
   exclusively uses Long header packets.

   This version of QUIC has a single packet type, and a set of frame
   types used to communicate network properties.  Furthermore, packets
   are protected using publicly-know keys, similar to the way Initial
   packets are protected in QUIC version 1.

4.  SCONEPRO QUIC Packets

   This version of QUIC only uses long header packets with the following
   format:

   Long Header Packet {
     Header Form (1) = 1,
     Fixed Bit (1) = 0,
     Packet Type (2) = 0,
     Reserved Bits (4),
     Version (32),
     Destination Connection ID Length (8),
     Destination Connection ID (8..160),
     Source Connection ID Length (8),
     Source Connection ID (8..160),
     Payload (..),
   }

   Header Form:  The most significant bit (0x80) of byte 0 (the first
      byte) is set to 1 for long headers.

   Fixed Bit:  The next bit (0x40) of byte 0 is set to 1.

   Packet Type:  The next two bits contain a packet type.  A single
      packet type is defined for this protocol with the value 0b00.
      Future extensions MAY add new packet types.  A network device MUST
      ignore packets with unknown packet types and SHOULD forward such
      packets.

   Reserved Bits:  These bits are reserved for future use and SHOULD be
      set to 0.

   Version:  This QUIC version uses the value 0x5509c337, which was
      chosen at random.

   Destination Connection ID Length:  The byte following the version
      contains the length in bytes of the Destination Connection ID
      field that follows it.  This length is encoded as an 8-bit
      unsigned integer.

   Destination Connection ID:  The Destination Connection ID field
      follows the Destination Connection ID Length field, which
      indicates the length of this field.  A Destination Connection ID
      MUST be at least 8 bytes long.

   Source Connection ID Length:  The byte following the Destination
      Connection ID contains the length in bytes of the Source
      Connection ID field that follows it.  This length is encoded as an
      8-bit unsigned integer.

   Source Connection ID:  The Source Connection ID field follows the
      Source Connection ID Length field, which indicates the length of
      this field.  A Source Connection ID MUST be at least 8 bytes long.

5.  Packet Protection

   This version of QUIC uses packet protection as defined for Initial
   packets in section 5 of [QUIC-TLS].

   This version of QUIC does not use packet numbers, therefore nonces
   are created by combining the intial destination connection ID with
   the source connection ID of the packet.  Each SCONEPRO QUIC packet
   mus use a randomly generated source connection ID with a high
   probability of being unique.

5.1.  Public Salt

   A publicly known salt is used to derive the secrets, specifically
   sconepro_salt=0x6784619005cadc9bb961ec4d31b76892eb1b567e.

5.2.  HKDF Labels

   The labels used in [QUIC-TLS] to derive packet protection keys
   (Section 5.1), header protection keys (Section 5.4) change from "quic
   key" to "quicscone key", from "quic iv" to "quicscone iv", from "quic
   hp" to "quicscone hp", to meet the guidance for new versions in
   Section 9.6 of that document.

6.  Frames

   The payload of a SCONEPRO QUIC packet consists of a sequence of
   frames.  Frames consist of a type field optionally followed by type
   specific payload.

6.1.  Padding Frame

   Padding frames are defined in section 19.1 of [RFC9000] and are used
   to increase the size of a packet.

   PADDING Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x00,
   }

6.2.  Data Frame

   DATA Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x01,
     Length (i),
     Payload (..),
   }

   Length:  The length of the DATA Frame payload in bytes.

   Payload:  SCONEPRO specific payload such as media bitrate
      information.

6.3.  Alternative Hosts Frame

   Used to communicate alternative endpoints to which a client can
   connect to obtain confidentiality of the communication.

   Alternative Hosts Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x02,
     Host (..)..,
   }

   Host:  A tuple consisting of a host name, port and a QUIC protocol
      version.  (TODO define format)

7.  Communication Overview

   The goal of SCONEPRO is to provide a way to communicate properties
   between an on-path network device and a QUIC client endpoint, with
   the QUIC client responsible for the initiation of that communication.

   Before establishing the SCONEPRO communication, a QUIC client
   establishes its normal end to end connection as per usual from RFC
   9000.  Once this is done, the client opportunistically sends a
   SCONEPRO QUIC packet destined to the same endpoint IP address and
   port.  This packet can be be parsed by any SCONEPRO-capable network
   element on the path.  A SCONEPRO-capable elements MAY forward these
   packets in the normal fashion, such that all SCONEPRO-capable devices
   can see its contents.  All SCONEPRO-capable elements are able to
   respond in a similar fashion, by creating their own SCONEPRO QUIC
   packets and sending it to the SCONEPRO QUIC client matching the IP/
   port tuple being utilized by the end to end QUIC connection.

   The SCONEPRO QUIC client MUST be able to distinguish the end to end
   QUIC packets and the SCONEPRO QUIC packets.  This can be done by
   looking for the pattern of the SCONEPRO packet, combined with trial
   decryption.

7.1.  Use of Connection IDs

   SCONEPRO QUIC packets contain both Source and Destination Connection
   IDs.  A client who initiates SCONEPRO communication sets both Source
   and Destination Connection IDs to randomly generated values.  A
   network device that 'responds' to a SCONEPRO QUIC packet sets the
   Destination Connection ID to the value of the Source Connection ID of
   the packet it responds to.  The network device sets the Source
   Connection ID to a randomly generated value.

8.  On Path Verification

   SCONEPRO communication MUST only be done with network elements that
   can be verified to be on the same network path as an end to end QUIC
   flow.  This is because SCONEPRO communication is only meant to be
   done with network elements that have the ability to, for example,
   modify and drop packets relevant to an end to end QUIC flow.  As
   SCONEPRO QUIC packets are themselves carried in separate UDP
   datagrams from the end to end QUIC flow, there is not an inherent
   guarantee that they were generated by a network element.

   A SCONEPRO network device MUST set the Destination Connection ID
   Length and Destination Connection ID fields to the values received in
   the most recently observed SCONEPRO QUIC packet sent by a client.

9.  Extensibility To Provide Confidentiality and Authenticity

   The use of keys derived from a publicly known salt does not allow for
   confidentiality or authenticity of the communication.  The only
   manner of authenticity defined in this document is verification of
   the on-path nature of a network element.  It may be desirable for
   SCONEPRO to be extended to allow for confidentiality and
   authenticity.

   Confidentiality with this protocol could be achieved by further
   leveraging the provisions of QUIC version 1 to do a TLS handshake
   between the SCONEPRO QUIC client and a SCONEPRO-capable network
   element.  Authenticity could similarly leverage the provisions of
   TLS.  However, this comes with significant complications.  TLS
   achieves authenticity by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), where
   each participant can choose to trust the certificate offered by their
   peer.  While this PKI exists today for Internet endpoints, there is
   no such existing PKI for network elements.  It is important to note
   that conducting a TLS handshake would restrict the communication
   between the QUIC client and exactly one on-path network element.

   Alternatively, a network element could advertise a set of hosts to
   which the client can connect using QUIC version 1.
